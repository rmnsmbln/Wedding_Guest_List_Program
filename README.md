# Wedding_Guest_List_Program

## File Output
- **File Name**: `all_guests.txt`
- **Location**: Same folder as the script.
- **Format**: Lists all guests with their total scores, sorted highest to lowest, plus a total count.

## Notes
- The program overwrites `all_guests.txt` each time it runs. If you want to keep old lists, rename the file before running again.
- Maximum score per guest is 100 (5×5 + 4×5 + 7×5 + 4×5).
- Only the top 200 guests show in the terminal, but all are saved to the file.

## Future Improvements
- Move to a graphical interface (e.g., with `tkinter`).
- Add editing or deleting guests.
- Save individual question scores in the file.

### How to Use This README
1. Save it as `README.md` in the same folder as your script.
2. If you share this on GitHub or another platform, it’ll format nicely with headers and bullets.
3. Edit any section (e.g., add your name under "Author") if you want to personalize it.

Does this look good? Want to adjust anything—like adding a section for installation steps or tweaking the tone? Also, since you’ve been interested in a GUI, I can update the README to reflect that if we switch to the `tkinter` version next!
